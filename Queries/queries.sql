-- Determine Retirement Eligibility Bobbys boss has determined that anyone born between 1952 and 1955 will begin to retire. 
-- The first query we need to help Bobby write will return a list of those employees.

-- Use Left Join to Capture retirement-info Table. We'll need to help Bobby recreate this list. Think about what we need to have a fully accurate retirement_info table:
--Employee number
--Employee name (first and last)
--If the person is presently employed with PH

-- Because of the number of people leaving each department, the boss has requested three lists that are more specific:
-- Employee Information: A list of employees containing their unique employee number, their last name, first name, gender, and salary
-- Management: A list of managers for each department, including the department number, name, and the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and the starting and ending employment dates
--Department Retirees: An updated current_emp list that includes everything it currently has, but also the employee's departments
-- List 1: Employee Information

-- The next list to work on involves the management side of the business. Many employees retiring are part of the management team, and these positions require training, so Bobby is creating this list to reflect the upcoming departures. This list includes the manager's employee number, first name, last name, and their starting and ending employment dates.
-- List 2: List of managers per department
