# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview 
Determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program to assist with preparing current employees for changes in the company after those due to retire leave the company.

## Results Summary 
- Pewlett-Hackard currently has over 300,000 total employees companywide.
- There are roughly 88,800 employees due to retire within various roles, most are coming from Senior Engineer or Senior Staff roles, both over 28,000 total retirees.
- If a Mentorship Program is created, there will be just over 1,900 employees to assist with future retirement transitions.
- The positions within the mentorship program with the most employees are Staff and Senior Engineers both over 600 employees. This will help aid in our higher turnover rates for these departments where the most retirments will be occuring.


## Pewlett-Hackard Analysis Summary 
Out of the 300,000+ total employees, there will be 88,798 that are retiring. With this data, we were able to review the next group of retirees to help assist with the next wave of openings due to retirements. There are over 1,900 employees preparing to retire in the upcoming years who will be able to help better prepare current staff for their leave and potential promotion preparation for those qualified by experience and tenure.

Many employees retiring are either Senior Staff or Senior Engineers, and these positions will require additional training for anyone eligible for an internal promotion to the senior role. Based on data we have on our current employees, we have been able to determine those who may qualify for potential promotions that have been with the company for 2 years or longer, and would have the experience needed to help assist in the retirement wave.

We can see here that there are over 64,500 Engineers and 59,684 various Staff positions who have been with the company longer than 2 years. With this information we can then narrow down who may be eligible for promotion based on comparing this information with recent performance reviews. Anyone in eligible can then in turn assist with the training of any newer potential staff that may be hired.

With the large amount of employees retiring, there will be the benefit of now retaining their paid salaries at an overwhelming amount of $23,504,878,993. In the following image you can see where these funds will become available to either promoting any qualified current staff into senior roles, or being able to hire anyone outside of the organization that may have further qualifications that we were not able to afford previously. The roles that will have the most employees retiring, alone will have $5,432,205,672 for Senior Staff and $4,741,534,989 for Senior Engineers.
